# Travel Planner App

#### Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Code structure

The page consists of three main blocks: the Form, Current trip and a List of saved trips. The Current trip section is initially hidden and is made visible upon successful Form submission or if the user selects a trip from the List.
In the form start typing in the desired destination and the app will display a list of suggested locations. As you type more letters the choice narrows down. Clicking on a suggested place will put it's name into the input field. The best way to use the app is to select one of the found suggestions as this saves the geoname id for faster processing later.
